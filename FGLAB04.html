        <h1>AI's Good, Bad, and Ugly.</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This article taps five Virginia Tech engineering professors, from mechanical to computer science, to explore AI’s real-world impact. Skipping hype, it shows how AI shapes daily life, like medical devices and construction. Titled “The good, the bad, and the scary,” it balances excitement for AI’s potential with its challenges.</p>

        <h2>The Good</h2>
        <p>On the positive side, AI opens doors for accessibility, boosts safety in construction, and supports smarter cities and transportation. Tools like large language models make interaction with machines easier, while machine learning helps researchers process data at speeds far beyond human ability.</p>

        <h2>The Bad</h2>
        <p>The downsides are hard to ignore. AI can reproduce bias if its training data are flawed, and overreliance on these systems may dull human judgment. There’s also the environmental cost: the energy needed to run massive AI models leaves a large carbon footprint. Missteps in applying AI to industries could make outcomes worse instead of better.</p>

        <h2>The Ugly</h2>
        <p>The scarier part is how AI might reshape society itself. Algorithms already influence what people see and believe, while AI-generated text can blur the line between genuine communication and manipulation. Combined with job disruption and environmental strain, the risks show how powerful and unsettling this technology can be.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Looking forward, the article stresses that AI’s future depends on how we guide it. Responsible research, ethical design, and cross-disciplinary collaboration will decide whether it becomes a tool for progress or a source of harm. The challenge is balancing innovation with human values.</p>
